# KPMG_Internship

This project was a virtual internship for KPMG. The goal of the project was to use raw data from 20,000 customer sales, gain an understanding of profitable customers, and then provide guidance to the marketing team for 1,000 new potential clients.

This project is still a work in progress, but the parts that are complete are the message to Sprocket Central's data team to clarify what had been received from the client. The visual dashboard of historic sales was also complete (see screenshot below):

I still plan to return to this project and go deeper on cluster analysis. I believe I can use what I have learned about the K-Prototypes method to better segment this largely categorical data set and provide the client with a breakdown of their higher-profit clientele.
